This is Jiayin Zhu's new page!

I am a CS Ph.D. student at the [CVML group](https://cvml.comp.nus.edu.sg/) of the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS), under the supervision of [Prof. Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/). My current research interest focuses on 3D hand reconstruction.

I also received the degree of Master of Computing from NUS. Previously, I studied [Information Management and Information System](https://sme.bit.edu.cn/English/programs/enbk/majors/b131767.htm) at the [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).
