This is Jiayin Zhu's new page!

I am a Ph.D. student in computer science in the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS). My current research interest is focused on 3D computer vision.

I also received the degree of Master of Computing from NUS. Previously, I studied [Information Management and Information System](https://sme.bit.edu.cn/English/programs/enbk/majors/b131767.htm) at the [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).
